The goal of `hglmbc2` is to make inferences in Small Area Estimation based on Hierarchical ($h-$)likelihood approach with bias correction. The model parameters are obtained through an iterative approximation based on Newton Raphson method. The bias correction approach enhances the accuracy of maximum hierarchical likelihood estimates (MHLEs). This R package can be used to obtain improved MHLEs for `fixed effects`, `random effects`, and `dispersion parameters` for exponential family distributions with random effect `u` being normally distributed.  


## Installation

You can install the released version of hglmbc from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("hglmbc2")
```

or, you can install the development version of hglmbc using [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) with:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, comment=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("niroshar/hglmbc2", force = TRUE)
```


#### Example 1

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
