Description: This R package is built to apply h-likelihood approach with bias correction to make inferences in Small Area Estimation.
    The bias correction approach enhances the accuracy of maximum hierarchical likelihood estimates (MHLEs). 
    The model parameters are obtained through an iterative approximation.
